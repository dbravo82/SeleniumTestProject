* Testing solution:
    I chose to use XPath expressions to locate all the elements because there are many elements
    without an id or name to find them.
    In the booking page chosing concrete flights the flights for go and return have the same elements and
    attributes so i need to put a sleep time to be sure that the first flight is already selected and i can
    select the return flight

    I close the cookies policy pop up to make visible some elements that i need to interact to later

* How to run the test
    Chrome driver is in the project and i set property webdriver.chrome.driver pointing to this file.
    Therefore you don't need any configuration for this.
    There are some requirements to run this test:
        - Google chrome browser
        - Java 1.8
        - maven
    Execute:
        mvn test
    In the project root directory

* Reports
    Find reporting for the test under folder reports/test-report. Open index.html file
